/*
Maximum Average Subarray бы

You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

/*
Sliding Window Approach
1. First, calculate the sum of the first k elements. This sum represents the sum of the initial window.
2. Starting from the k-th element, slide the window one element at a time to the right. For each new element added to the window, update the window sum by subtracting the element that is left out from the window and adding the new element. This method efficiently updates the current window sum without recalculating the entire sum from scratch.
3. After each shift of the window, compare the current window sum to the maximum sum recorded so far. Update the maximum sum if the current window sum is greater.
4. After processing all possible windows, return the maximum sum divided by k to get the maximum average.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
