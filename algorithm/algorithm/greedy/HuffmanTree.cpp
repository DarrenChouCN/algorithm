Gold Bar Cutting Problem
You have a gold bar of length n, and you want to divide it into smaller pieces. Each time you cut the gold bar, the cost is equal to the length of the gold bar you are cutting. The goal is to split the gold bar into multiple pieces in such a way that the total cost of all the cuts is minimized.
